## Syntax reference

> [!NOTE]
> **Blocks**
>
> - `[!SCHEDULE-META]` (optional): text after the marker is a short summary. List items are free-form entries for
>   your own bookkeeping, written like `` x-owner: `team-xyz` ``.
> - `[!SCHEDULE-BASE] <state>` (optional): the state wherever no range applies.
> - `[!SCHEDULE-STATE] <state>`: one block per state, each with a list of ranges.
>
> **States:** `Off`, `Minimum`, `Medium`, `Maximum`.
>
> **Ranges:** `` `start` to `end` WEEKDAYS ``
>
> - Times are `H:MM` or `HH:MM`, e.g. `6:15` or `21:45`.
> - The end is exclusive: `06:00` to `22:00` covers 06:00 up to, but not including, 22:00.
> - A range that runs until midnight ends at `00:00`. There is no `24:00`.
> - A range may cross midnight: `22:00` to `02:00` FRI runs from Friday 22:00 into Saturday 02:00.
> - Equal start and end means a full 24 hours: `08:00` to `08:00` MON runs until Tuesday 08:00.
>
> **Weekdays:** `MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT SUN`, uppercase. Ranges like `MON-FRI` (also across the weekend,
> `FRI-MON`) and lists like `SAT,SUN`. Weekday ranges include both ends: `MON-FRI` includes Friday, while the end
> time of a range is excluded. Write each weekday at most once per range.
>
> **Overlaps:** later ranges win where they overlap earlier ones.
